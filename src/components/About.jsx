        <p>
          I am a dedicated Full Stack Developer specializing in the MERN stack
          (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and TypeScript, with a strong
          focus on creating intuitive, scalable, and high-performance web
          applications. My portfolio includes impactful projects such as a Video
          Sharing Platform, University Portal, and a Restaurant Menu Website,
          each showcasing my ability to deliver seamless user experiences and
          robust backend functionality. During my 8-month internship at 10X
          Academy in Hyderabad, I refined my skills in building efficient and
          innovative solutions that address real-world challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am committed to continuous learning and staying ahead of industry
          trends by exploring new tools, frameworks, and technologies. My goal
          is to deliver future-proof applications that not only meet user needs
          but also drive business growth. With a collaborative mindset and a
          keen eye for detail, I thrive in team environments, working to create
          cutting-edge solutions that leave a lasting impact.
